# About

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Machine Learning at the University of Tübingen. I am passionate about using technical expertise to help solve the world's most pressing problems. I believe that machine learning is the most important technology of my time (and its also tons of fun), so currently I spend most of my time learning about it.

On those rare occasions that I'm not coding or reading textbooks you could spot me rock climbing, reading or walking in the forest.

This website is currently under construction. If you are interested in my professional endeavours please refer to my [linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eekortukov/).

If you want to see what I've been coding lately check out my [github account](https://github.com/kortukov).
